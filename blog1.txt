Darkness is tranquil. 
A cozy corner for the broken hearted.
Darkness comes with a sense of peace.
Close your eyes at your at ease.
Darkness also conceals ugly deeds  
That of thy ungodly creed.
Many may befriend her. 
Many may offend her.
A seductress of a cult; queen of the night.
She welcomes into her arms, a tearful plight.
Lurking enemies she preserves.
In the places, she is revered.
For most of the deeds done undercover.
Performed under the mantle, of her.
Soulful, in her embrace.
The beauty of her darkness cannot be captured.
Adorned with stars for jewels and moon for a tikka.
Such is her beauty; which cannot be contained.
Even by the best artist in a portrait.
Her darkness; the significance of light.
She is the queen herself; the NIGHT
