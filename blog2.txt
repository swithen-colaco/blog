One in a many

How often does this happen, how often!
How often do I fail to thank,
One, that offered me a helping hand.
How often do I fail to express,
The gratitude showed when I was in distress.
How often are my words not adequate,
Of the kind gestures, one has shown.
How often have I been ungrateful,
When you attended to my sick call.
How often, will I be forgiven?
For all the things I have done wrong.
How often do I cease to praise,
That beautiful smile upon your face.
How often will I pass by,
And not notice the beauty of nature.
How often do I stop to think,
Of the memories, I once have lived.
How often have I seen you cry,
And failed to catch a tear roll down ur eye.
How often was I there when you needed me.
How often I turned selfish from greed.
For all the deeds undone I do regret.
At this ripe age of 80, waiting for someone to come visit.
With my mind working; my body dead.
